Please provide me with more context! 

To create a helpful How-To guide on wireframing, I need to know:

* **What kind of wireframing are we talking about?** 
    * Website wireframes?
    * Mobile app wireframes?
    * Prototypes?
    * Something else?
* **What is the target audience?** 
    * Beginners with no experience?
    * Experienced designers looking for advanced techniques?
* **What specific aspects of wireframing do you want to cover?** 
    * Basic principles?
    * Tools and software?
    * Different wireframing techniques?
    * Best practices?

Once I have this information, I can create a comprehensive and useful How-To guide for you.
