Please provide me with more context! I need to know what you want to wireframe before I can create a guide. 

For example, tell me:

* **What type of thing are you wireframing?**  A website? A mobile app? A physical product? A process?
* **What is the purpose of the wireframe?** Is it to show the basic layout, to test user flow, or to communicate ideas to stakeholders?
* **What tools are you planning to use?** There are many different wireframing tools available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Once I have this information, I can create a helpful and specific How-To guide for wireframing your project.
