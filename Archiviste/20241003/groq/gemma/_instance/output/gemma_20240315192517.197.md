## How to use gemme in .zshrc ps3_config.sh

Here's how to use gemme in .zshrc ps3_config.sh:

**1. Install gemme:**

```
sudo gem install gemme
```

**2. Add the following lines to your .zshrc file:**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc

export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/bin"

alias gemme='gemme --no-banner'
```

**3. Restart your shell:**

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Now you can use gemme commands in your shell:**

```
gemme list
gemme install my_gem
gemme update
```

**Additional notes:**

* The `gemme` command is a wrapper around the `gem` command, but with some additional features such as the ability to install gems from a local directory.
* The `--no-banner` flag suppresses the banner that is displayed by `gemme` by default.
* You may need to adjust the `PATH` line in your .zshrc file if `gemme` is not in your system's path.
* You can find more information about gemme on the official website: `gemme.github.io`

**Here are some examples of how to use gemme:**

```
gemme list
gemme install rails
gemme update
gemme search ruby-gems
```

**Please note:**

* This is just a sample configuration, you may need to modify it based on your specific needs.
* You can find more information about customizing your .zshrc file on the zsh documentation website: `zsh.net/doc/custom-shell-environment`
