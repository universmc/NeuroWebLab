## How to use groq Model gemma in .zshrc ps3_config.sh

Here's how to use the groq Model gemma in .zshrc ps3_config.sh:

**1. Install dependencies:**

```bash
sudo gem install groq model-gemma
```

**2. Create a .zshrc file:**

If you don't already have one, create a `.zshrc` file in your home directory. You can use the following command:

```bash
touch ~/.zshrc
```

**3. Add the following lines to your .zshrc:**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc

model_gemma_path="/path/to/model_gemma.rb"
export GROQ_MODEL_GEMMA_PATH="$model_gemma_path"

alias groq='groq -p $GROQ_MODEL_GEMMA_PATH'
```

**4. Replace `/path/to/model_gemma.rb` with the actual path to your `model_gemma.rb` file.**

**5. Restart your shell:**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Now you can use the `groq` command to interact with your model.**

**Here are some examples:**

```bash
groq "Hello, world!"
# Output: Hello, world!

groq "What is the meaning of life?"
# Output: I do not have the answer to that question.
```

**Additional notes:**

* You may need to adjust the `model_gemma_path` variable based on the actual location of your `model_gemma.rb` file.
* You can find more information about the groq Model gemma on the groq documentation website: [here](/docs/model-gemma)
* You can also find a tutorial on how to use the groq Model gemma in the groq documentation: [here](/docs/model-gemma/usage)

**Please note:** This is just a sample configuration. You may need to modify it based on your specific needs.
